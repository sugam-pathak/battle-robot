This project is a 15 kg weight-class battle robot designed for competitive robotic combat. The bot uses a 4-wheel drive system powered by Johnson DC motors and features a single horizontal spinning weapon for high-impact attacks. The design focuses on durability, stability, and aggressive combat performance.

⚙️ Key Features

Weight Class: 15 kg (Featherweight)

Drive System: 4× Johnson DC motors (independent wheel drive)

Weapon System: High-speed horizontal spinner

Chassis: Steel sheet frame for strength and impact resistance

Control: RC-based wireless control system

Power System: High-discharge Li-ion/LiPo battery with ESCs
📷 Circuit Design & Images

Below are the images of the drive and weapon control circuit used in this battle bot. The circuit was designed using circuit design software, so no custom PCB was required.
